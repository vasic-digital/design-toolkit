# upstreams-recipe-origin-check.sh — wrong-organisation push guard.
#
# WHAT THIS CATCHES, and why it is not cosmetic. Each `upstreams/<name>.sh`
# exports UPSTREAMABLE_REPOSITORY. The shared toolkit's push_all.sh turns every
# such file into a git remote named after the FILE (lowercased) and then runs
# `git push <name>` against it. A recipe therefore does not describe a
# repository — it SELECTS the repository this tree's commits are published to.
#
# On 2026-09-01 a sibling module of this fleet was found with an
# `upstreams/github.sh` naming one organisation while its `origin` named
# another. Both repositories existed, with divergent default branches, so a
# wrapper-driven push would have aimed that tree's history at the wrong
# account — and it would have looked like an ordinary successful push.
# The wrong word was a single hyphenated org name in a three-line file.
#
# See upstreams/README.md for what this repository's own recipes target and
# why one of them is deliberately inert.
#
# Nothing here is hardcoded to this repository. Every expectation is DERIVED
# from `git remote get-url origin` at run time, so this file is a drop-in for
# any project's challenges/scripts/ directory (§11.4.28(B)).
#
# Assertions, per recipe:
#   1. it exports a non-empty UPSTREAMABLE_REPOSITORY
#   2. its ORGANISATION equals origin's organisation, exactly. This is the
#      wrong-org defect above; case is not forgiven here because two orgs
#      differing only by case are two different accounts on both major forges.
#   3. its REPOSITORY NAME equals origin's, case-insensitively. A forge may
#      hold the canonical name as `Containers` while a sibling recipe writes
#      `containers`; measured on GitHub, both resolve to one repository, so a
#      case difference is reported as a NOTE and is not a failure.
#   4. it is executable, like its siblings — a recipe that push_all.sh sources
#      rather than executes still reads as a script to every human and tool
#      that meets it.
#   5. it ends with a newline. `cat` of a recipe without one runs its last line
#      into the next file's shebang, which is exactly how the wrong-org line
#      escaped notice.
#
# Exit:
#   0 = every recipe names this repository
#   1 = at least one recipe would publish this tree somewhere else
#   2 = COULD NOT DETERMINE — no upstreams/ directory, no origin remote, or
#       an origin URL this challenge cannot parse. NEVER a pass.
